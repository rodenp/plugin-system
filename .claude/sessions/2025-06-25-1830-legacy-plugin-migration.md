# Legacy Plugin Migration Session
**Started:** 2025-06-25 18:30  
**Active Session**

## Session Overview
This session focuses on migrating older plugins that still have Redux dependencies, replacing Tailwind with theme-based CSS, and moving mock data to the demo file.

## Goals
- [ ] Identify legacy plugins with Redux dependencies
- [ ] Migrate Redux usage to storage-agnostic interfaces 
- [ ] Replace Tailwind classes with CSS using new theming system
- [ ] Move mock data from plugins to new-plugin-system-demo.tsx
- [ ] Ensure all legacy plugins follow new architecture patterns

## Legacy Plugins Identified
Found 3 legacy plugins with Redux dependencies:
1. **certificates** - Complex Redux slice with async thunks
2. **analytics** - Redux-based analytics tracking  
3. **user-management** - User state management

## Migration Strategy
For each plugin:
1. Remove Redux Toolkit dependencies (createSlice, createAsyncThunk)
2. Replace with storage-agnostic interfaces extending PluginProps
3. Move Redux state to demo app as mock data
4. Replace any Tailwind classes with theme-based CSS
5. Update imports to use new plugin interface
