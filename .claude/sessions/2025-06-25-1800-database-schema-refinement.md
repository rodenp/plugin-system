# Database Schema Refinement Session
**Started:** 2025-06-25 18:00  
**Ended:** 2025-06-25 18:30

## Session Overview
This session focused on refining the plugin system database schema, removing JSON fields, adding proper table relationships, and creating visual documentation.

## Goals Achieved
- ✅ Updated database schema to remove JSON fields and normalize data
- ✅ Added proper Module and Lesson models for course structure
- ✅ Created separate Authors table to normalize content creation
- ✅ Added CommunityMember junction table for membership tracking
- ✅ Generated visual ERD diagrams in multiple formats
- ✅ Updated TypeScript interfaces to match new schema

## Key Technical Changes

### Database Schema Updates
1. **Removed JSON fields from User table**:
   - Expanded `profile` JSON into individual columns (`name`, `bio`, `avatar`, `level`, `pointsToNext`, `joinDate`)

2. **Created new Author table**:
   - Separated user authentication data from content authorship
   - One-to-one relationship with User table
   - Eliminates duplicate `author` fields in Post/Comment tables

3. **Added proper course structure**:
   - Course → Module → Lesson hierarchy
   - Removed JSON `modules` field from Course table
   - Added proper foreign key relationships with cascade deletes

4. **Added community membership tracking**:
   - Created `CommunityMember` junction table
   - Supports user roles: member, moderator, admin
   - Tracks join dates and membership history
   - Separates ownership (Community.ownerId) from membership

5. **Cleaned up Post table**:
   - Removed `level` field (access control)
   - Removed duplicate `author` field (now references Author table)
   - Changed `commenters` JSON to `commentersCount` integer

### Files Modified
- `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Complete schema restructure
- `/src/storage/StorageProvider.ts` - Updated TypeScript interfaces
- `/spec/data-model.md` - Updated documentation with table views
- `/spec/erd-generator.html` - Created visual ERD with Mermaid
- `/spec/generate-erd.py` - Python script for Graphviz ERD
- `/spec/database-erd.puml` - PlantUML ERD diagram

## Visual Documentation Created
1. **HTML ERD Generator** (`/spec/erd-generator.html`):
   - Interactive Mermaid diagram
   - Horizontal layout for better viewing
   - Foreign key mapping table
   - Right-click to save as PNG

2. **Python ERD Generator** (`/spec/generate-erd.py`):
   - High-quality Graphviz output
   - Color-coded tables by function
   - Clear FK indicators

3. **PlantUML Diagram** (`/spec/database-erd.puml`):
   - Professional ERD format
   - Can be rendered online or with PlantUML tools

## New Relationships Established
- User (1:1) Author - Each user can have an author profile
- User (1:N) Community - Users can own multiple communities
- User (M:N) Community - Users can be members of multiple communities via CommunityMember
- Author (1:N) Post/Comment/Course - Authors create content
- Course (1:N) Module (1:N) Lesson - Hierarchical learning structure
- User (M:N) Post - Like functionality via PostLike junction table

## Technical Insights
- **Normalization Benefits**: Eliminating JSON fields makes data queryable and maintainable
- **Separation of Concerns**: User (auth) vs Author (content) vs CommunityMember (permissions)
- **Flexibility**: Role-based community access with extensible permission system
- **Performance**: Denormalized counts (likes, comments) for read optimization

## Issues Encountered & Resolved
1. **Naming Convention**: Changed `displayName` to `name` for consistency
2. **Layout Optimization**: Made ERD horizontal for better printing/viewing
3. **Foreign Key Clarity**: Added comprehensive FK mapping documentation
4. **Slash Commands**: Discovered commands exist but may need proper registration

## Next Steps
1. **Database Migration**: Create Prisma migration for schema changes
2. **Storage Implementation**: Implement PostgreSQL storage adapter with new schema
3. **Slash Commands**: Investigate why `/project:*` commands aren't appearing in Claude Code
4. **Plugin Updates**: Update existing plugins to work with new Author model
5. **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests for new relationships

## Files Ready for Review
- Database schema is fully normalized and documented
- Visual ERDs available in multiple formats for team review
- TypeScript interfaces updated to match new schema
- All foreign key relationships clearly documented

## Context for Future Sessions
- Database credentials updated in `.env` (PostgreSQL connection)
- All mock data patterns established for normalized structure
- Community membership system ready for implementation
- Course module/lesson structure prepared for learning features

**Session completed successfully with all major goals achieved.**
