**Session Started:** 2025-06-26 13:00  
**Session ID:** 2025-06-26-1300-community-interactions-modal

## Session Overview
- **Start Time:** June 26, 2025 at 1:00 PM
- **Project:** React Plugin Market Community System
- **Focus:** Implementing interactive community post modal with social media-style features

## Goals
Based on the provided screenshot, implement a comprehensive community post interaction system:

1. **Post Detail Modal**
   - Full-screen modal dialog that opens when clicking on a community post
   - Display complete post content with author info, timestamp, and category
   - Show post engagement metrics (likes, comments)
   - Include post image/media support

2. **User Interactions**
   - Like/unlike posts with visual feedback and count updates
   - Comment on posts with threaded conversation support
   - Reply to comments creating nested thread structure
   - Like individual comments
   - @mention functionality for tagging other users

3. **Modal Features**
   - Clean, modern UI matching the screenshot design
   - User avatars with level badges
   - Timestamp display (relative time: "May 14", "26d", etc.)
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Proper modal behavior (ESC to close, backdrop click, etc.)

4. **Comment Threading**
   - Support nested replies (minimum 2-3 levels deep)
   - "View more replies" functionality for collapsed threads
   - Proper indentation and visual hierarchy for thread structure
   - Individual like counts for each comment/reply

5. **Data Persistence**
   - All interactions should persist using the existing community service
   - Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
   - Proper error handling with rollback on failures

## Technical Approach
- Extend existing `CommunityFeedComponent.tsx` with modal integration
- Create new `PostDetailModal.tsx` component
- Enhance `community-service.ts` with comment threading and interaction methods
- Update type definitions in `types.ts` for new data structures
- Implement proper state management for modal and interaction states
